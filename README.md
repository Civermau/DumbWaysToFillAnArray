Dumb ways to code

So many dumb ways to code

Dumb ways to co-o-ode

So many dumb ways to code

-
Try-catch without end

Poke at code 'round the bend

Use arrays that never end

Infinite loops that never mend

So many dumb ways to code

Dumb ways to co-o-ode

So many dumb ways to code

-
Search for index, take a chance

In arrays without a glance

Fill them all with just one stance

Endless loops, no circumstance

Dictionary, oh so grand

Key-value pairs, understand

In a loop, take a stand

Fill the array, all unplanned

Lists that never seem to cease

Adding elements, no peace

Endless work, code won't release

Infinite loops, oh what a tease
